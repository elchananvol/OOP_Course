In this project i'm implementing tic-tac-toe game.

in the command line user should type those four arguments:
1. the number of round options: int > 0
2. the way to print the board. options: console/none
3. type of first player. options: human/clever/whatever/snartypamts
4. type of second player. options: human/clever/whatever/snartypamts

the way of non human players play:
whatever - play absolutely randomly.
clever - fill coordinate after coordinate by columns
snartypamts - check if the opponent gonna to win then block it, otherwise fill coordinate after coordinate by rows


if you choose human you will play the coordinate, you can choose to play against non human player.
10000 between whatever player to himself we get:" player 1: 4981 | player 2: 4977 | Draws: 42" ~ same
500 between whatever with clever player we get:  player 1: 65 | player 2: 435 | Draws: 0  ~ 87% for clever
500 between clever with himself we get:  === player 1: 250 | player 2: 250 | Draws: 0 ===. ~ same
500 between clever with snartypamts we get: === player 1: 52 | player 2: 448 | Draws: 0 === ===. 90% for the smarter
500 between whatever with snartypamts we get: === player 1: 47 | player 2: 452 | Draws: 1 ===. 90% for smarterer
500 between snartypamts with himself we get: === player 1: 146 | player 2: 138 | Draws: 216 ===. ~ same
