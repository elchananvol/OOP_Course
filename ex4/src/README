Few words about this assignment:
It was unclear few of the details of implantation but I did the best to make good work. we built a good
structure of class shell:
1. Init at constructor with image In the run method we get all the commands
2. for every command we have a function to deal with it.
In addition, I added help command to print to console all about the option.
Important use at Collection library:
    1. for hold the set of characters.
    2. for saving cache of sub image brightness and characters brightness in BrightnessImgCharMatcher as hash map
        to find easy.
    3. converting list to set and opposite.

About cache:
in run time of render we are using cache to save all characters that was calculated there brightness,
and to save sub_images mean brightness.




Algorithm part:
To find this duplicate in array i'm using with floyd algorithm in O(n) time complexity. here you can find details:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Tortoise_and_hare.

to find duplicated morse code presentation of words im used at convert to morse shape end save in hash set. since set
 operation of find is o(1) and is saving just non-duplicate strings we return the set size. in addition, when s is
  number of word and m is the longest word then when using O(s) space and O(s*m) time complexity.
